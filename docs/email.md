User registration does not do mailbox verification, but users can add mailboxes on their own settings page.

When adding a mailbox, you must send a mailbox verification code. At this time, you must configure the email 
address configured in the background.

I use qq mailbox test is no problem, the specific configuration method, the built-in some information in the backend, 
a little modification can be used
